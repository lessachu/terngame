* padding around the logo icon is fucked up
* Save file has to include a hash of the team name
* patch up last updated logic
* Deal better with malformed JSON
* do I wnat to deal with muxing right now? - it's okay, you can just intercept on correct answers and pull the next puzzle info elsewhere
* Dupe view needs styling
* should probably obscure admin mode even more, like add some icon taps required to access
* hrm, the use of isValidStart code to set the current puzzle is... problematic.
* WTF number selector??
* Admin mode puzzle data editor
* definitely a race initializing mainactivity.  we may need the team loader listener after all.
* add support for view recycling
* Fix start time bug - blarg, currentTimeMillis vs elapsedRealTime
* add a confirmation dialog before you take a hint?
* sometimes a second MainActivity sneaks into the backstack: this is due to how I have start activity working.
* I think the hintlistener is possibly not thread safe
* list view for collection activity
* hrm, we currently allow multiple start codes (like, for puzzles that aren't done yet).
* should probably encode the names on the RFC tag
* make the empty view work aggin
* add the check for NFC capability early in the app
* style the grid view
* add art
* add a default unknown opponent placeholder
* style the battle bar
* hints don't work on pre-kitkat
* add a stronger hint on the main page about what to do
* add a pause to penalize wrong answers
* add a visual count of the score in royale


DONE:
* Make the start layout auto-adjust to different screen sizes
* Style for event title
* get rid of that top bar
* Add padding to the logo image
* textedits should only be one line
* Serialize guesses to JSON, properly quote it
* Read in event information
* Read in password file
* session should read in the password file and check against it
* Save file doesn't seem to work at all
* Read of data files should be off the UI thread
* Read in current puzzle data in TeamSTatus
* Convert the rest of the data files to be read off the UI thread
* Util function to strip out answer codes
* Save should be done off the UI thread
* Get the GuessActivity UI up.
* Add json path for specifying the wrong answer text dynamically
* Read in puzzle data files
* dedupe guesses
* Add in different UX for dupes? - maybe just add a line like, "you've already guessed that" to explain why answer log doesn't update
* fully hook up check for correctness
* set up a local git repository that backs up to dropbox
* Hook up AnswerLog UX
* Get rid of extra stuff on Guess view unless the puzzle is solved
* Support share intent
* crash on solve:             at com.twitter.terngame.data.TeamStatus$TeamDataSaverTask.doInBackground(TeamStatus.java:320)
* Clear All Data works
* Fix issue for the double start code issue - either block it if you've already started a puzzle
  - or disable the start code window
* Hide the start button and associated accoutrements if the puzzle is solved
* hook up the timer
* Serialize Dates to JSON
* If we've already solved or skipped a puzzle, entering the start code should show "Solved or Skipped Puzzle view"
* hitting back to go to the start activity is a little wonky
* we don't save on startcode only -
* document json format somewhere
* Add skip UX
* hook up skip logic
* package directions with each Puzzle and have a look up for which puzzle is next
* Add json support for puzzle button
* Add X puzzles skipped support to status button
* Add puzzle status page
* Style puzzle status rows
* Add json support for Hints
* Team status needs to save which hints are used
* make hint buttons display hints
* hints as a local notification
* hints as a local notification triggered by an alarm
* looking at a hint registers it as taken.
* hints info should display in the status page
* Hint list should register a listener for new hints with the Session
* use system alarm to determine when a hint is available
* hints not available until the proper time elapses
* correctly handling of the backstack from a hint notification
* clearing all data should clear all hints too
* Should coming back from a hint always land you on a "new hint" puzzle page, even if you've already  looked at them?
* NFC reading works
* Extra passed to TwittermonActivity is no longer a huge hack
* Throw up a different layout if the puzzle start code hasn't been entered (twittermon)
* if you win, you collect the pokemon!
* battlehistory button should stay on screen.
* make the grid a fragment
