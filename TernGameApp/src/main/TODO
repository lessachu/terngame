* patch up last updated logic
* Deal better with malformed JSON
* Dupe view needs styling
* should probably obscure admin mode even more, like add some icon taps required to access
* hrm, the use of isValidStart code to set the current puzzle is... problematic.
* Admin mode puzzle data editor
* definitely a race initializing mainactivity.  we may need the team loader listener after all.
* add support for view recycling
* Fix start time bug - blarg, currentTimeMillis vs elapsedRealTime
* sometimes a second MainActivity sneaks into the backstack: this is due to how I have start activity working.
* I think the hintlistener is possibly not thread safe
* make the empty view work aggin
* add art
* hints don't work on pre-kitkat
* fix pause loading after you login
* We shouldn't be crashing on return to app

* Why does the back activity flash when you dismiss the dialog?
* single opponent grid mode looks pretty crappy in dialog form
* gizmoduck png has something in the top right corner
* make hints buzz the device
* show hints that are longer than 1 minute in minutes, rather than seconds
* disable the Battle Royale button unless they've collected all six


DONE:
* Make the start layout auto-adjust to different screen sizes

* Hook up AnswerLog UX
* Get rid of extra stuff on Guess view unless the puzzle is solved

* Clear All Data works
* Fix issue for the double start code issue - either block it if you've already started a puzzle
  - or disable the start code window
* Hide the start button and associated accoutrements if the puzzle is solved
* hook up the timer
* Serialize Dates to JSON
* If we've already solved or skipped a puzzle, entering the start code should show "Solved or Skipped Puzzle view"
* hitting back to go to the start activity is a little wonky
* we don't save on startcode only -
* document json format somewhere

* package directions with each Puzzle and have a look up for which puzzle is next
* Add json support for puzzle button
* Add X puzzles skipped support to status button
* Add puzzle status page
* Style puzzle status rows

* hints as a local notification
* hints as a local notification triggered by an alarm
* looking at a hint registers it as taken.
* hints info should display in the status page
* Hint list should register a listener for new hints with the Session
* use system alarm to determine when a hint is available
* hints not available until the proper time elapses
* correctly handling of the backstack from a hint notification
* clearing all data should clear all hints too
* Should coming back from a hint always land you on a "new hint" puzzle page, even if you've already  looked at them?
* NFC reading works
* Extra passed to TwittermonActivity is no longer a huge hack
* Throw up a different layout if the puzzle start code hasn't been entered (twittermon)
